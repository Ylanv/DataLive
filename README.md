# DataLive.ai üß†üìä

**üèÜ 1st Place Winner ‚Äì LauzHack Mini Hackathon (GenAI Track)**
Organized by **LauzHack** and the **EPFL AI Team**

## Overview

**DataLive.ai** is a next-generation AI assistant for data exploration and visualization. It combines automated preprocessing, intelligent code generation, and multimodal reasoning ‚Äî all through a sleek and interactive Streamlit app.

Upload a `.csv` file, clean your data, ask natural language questions, generate plots, and even receive AI-driven insights from those plots. All computation is performed **locally**, keeping your data private while maximizing speed.

This project was built in under 24 hours during the **LauzHack Mini Hackathon 2025**, where it won **1st place** in the **Generative AI Track**.

---

## Why It's Different from ChatGPT

Unlike general-purpose tools like ChatGPT or Code Interpreter:

* **Your data is never uploaded to the LLM**
  ‚Üí We extract only essential metadata (e.g., column names, types, number of missing values) and send **that** to the model. This:

  * Preserves **data privacy**
  * Avoids **token overload** on large datasets
  * Ensures compatibility with **sensitive or proprietary files**

* **All code is executed locally**
  ‚Üí No need to copy/paste code; the app renders output instantly in the interface.

* **Lightning-fast interactions** thanks to **Streamlit**
  ‚Üí Near-instant feedback loop between code generation, execution, and visualization.

---

## Features

###  Automatic Data Profiling

* Data shape, summary statistics
* Missing values report
* Column data types and inferred structure

###  Smart Data Cleaning

Choose from:

* **Drop** rows with missing values
* **Fill** with column-wise **mean**
* **KNN Imputation**

###  Conversational Code Generation

* Powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o**

* Ask natural questions like:

  > "Show a pairplot of numerical features"
  > "Plot the class distribution as a bar chart"

* Returns **executable Python code**, auto-rendered as:

  * Seaborn heatmaps
  * Histograms
  * Boxplots
  * And more...

###  Multimodal Plot Analysis

* After generating a plot, ask:

  > "What can you conclude from this?"

* The image is sent to **Video-LLaMA2B** via a custom Hugging Face inference handler

* Returns **textual interpretation** of trends, outliers, and insights

###  Export & Traceability

* Save all generated code
* Export plots for reuse or reporting

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Streamlit
* **Backend**: Python (OpenAI API + Hugging Face Inference Endpoint)
* **LLMs**:

  * GPT-4o (OpenAI) ‚Äì Prompt-to-code generation
  * Video-LLaMA2B (DAMO-NLP-SG) ‚Äì Plot interpretation
* **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Execution**: Local sandboxed Python runtime (safe, fast, private)

---

## How It Works

1. Upload your `.csv` dataset
2. Receive an automatic summary of key stats
3. Select a data cleaning strategy
4. Ask a question or request a visualization
5. Get back both:

   * The **generated code**
   * The **rendered output**
6. (Optional) Ask for AI-based interpretation of the plot

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch Locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Environment Setup

You'll need:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`
* `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` (for the Video-LLaMA endpoint)

---

## Future Work

Here are some exciting features planned for the next iteration:

* **SQL Data Integration**
  ‚Üí Connect to relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and run natural language queries directly on live data.

* **NoSQL Support** *(MongoDB, Firebase, etc.)*
  ‚Üí Enable compatibility with document-based datasets.

* **Advanced Insight Generation**
  ‚Üí Incorporate models to automatically detect:

  * **Trends**
  * **Seasonality**
  * **Anomalies**
  * **Correlations and causal patterns**

* **Explainable AI Layer**
  ‚Üí Provide rationale behind detected trends or statistical recommendations.
